abstract: 'We report a measurement of the $\lambdab$ lifetime in the exclusive
decay $\lambdabjpsilm$ in $p \overline{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 
1.96~{\rm TeV}$ using an integrated luminosity of 1.0 ${\rm fb}^{-1}$ 
of data collected by the CDF II detector at the Fermilab
Tevatron. Using fully reconstructed  decays, we measure
$\tau(\lambdab) = 1.593 ~^{+0.083}_{-0.078} ~({\rm stat.}) \pm
0.033~{\rm (syst.)~ps}$. This is the single most precise measurement
of $\tau(\lambdab)$ and is 3.2 $\sigma$ higher than the current world
average.'
