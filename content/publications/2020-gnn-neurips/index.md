abstract: 'We develop and study FPGA implementations of algorithms for charged particle
tracking based on graph neural networks. The two complementary FPGA designs
are based on OpenCL, a framework for writing programs that execute across
heterogeneous platforms, and hls4ml, a high-level-synthesis-based compiler for
neural network to firmware conversion. We evaluate and compare the resource
usage, latency, and tracking performance of our implementations based on a
benchmark dataset. We find a considerable speedup over CPU-based execution
is possible, potentially enabling such algorithms to be used effectively in future
computing workflows and the FPGA-based Level-1 trigger at the CERN Large
Hadron Collider.'
