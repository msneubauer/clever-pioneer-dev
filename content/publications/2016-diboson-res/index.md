abstract: 'Searches for new heavy resonances decaying to $WW$, $WZ$, and $ZZ$ bosons are presented, using a data sample corresponding to 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$~\TeV{} collected with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.  Analyses selecting \vvqq, \lvqq, \llqq{} and \qqqq{} final states are combined, searching for a narrow-width resonance with mass between 500 and 3000~\GeV. The discriminating variable is either an invariant mass or a transverse mass. No significant
deviations from the Standard Model predictions are observed. Three benchmark models are tested:  a model predicting the existence of a new heavy scalar singlet, a simplified model predicting a
heavy vector-boson triplet, and a bulk Randall-Sundrum model with a heavy spin-2 graviton. Cross-section limits  are set at the 95\% confidence level and are
compared to theoretical cross-section predictions for a variety of models. The data exclude a scalar singlet with mass below \limScal~\GeV, a heavy vector-boson 
triplet with mass below \limHvt~\GeV{}, and a graviton with mass below \limGrav~\GeV. These results significantly extend the previous limits set using $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8\tev$'
