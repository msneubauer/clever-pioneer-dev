abstract: 'A search is presented for new resonances decaying to a $W$ or $Z$ boson and a Higgs boson in the $\ell^+ \ell^- b\bar b$, $\ell\nu b\bar b$, and
$\nu\bar{\nu} b\bar b$ channels in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt s = 13$~TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider using a total
integrated luminosity of $3.2$ fb$^{-1}$. The search is conducted by looking for a localized excess in the $WH$/$ZH$ invariant or transverse mass distribution.
No significant excess is observed, and the results are interpreted in terms of constraints on a simplified model based on a phenomenological Lagrangian of heavy vector triplets.'
