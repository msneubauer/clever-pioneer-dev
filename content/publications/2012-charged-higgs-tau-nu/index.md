abstract: 'The results of a search for charged Higgs bosons are presented.
The analysis is based on 4.6 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at
$\sqrt{s}=7$~TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron
Collider, using top quark pair events with a $\tau$ lepton in the final
state. The data are consistent with the expected background from Standard
Model processes. Assuming that the branching ratio of the charged Higgs
boson to a $\tau$ lepton and a neutrino is 100\%, this leads to upper
limits on the branching ratio of top quark decays to a $b$ quark and a
charged Higgs boson between 5\% and 1\% for charged Higgs boson masses ranging from
90~GeV to 160~GeV, respectively. In the context of the $m_h^{\text{max}}$
scenario of the MSSM, $\tan\beta$ above 12--26, as well as between 1
and 2--6, can be excluded for charged Higgs boson masses between 90~GeV
and 150~GeV.'
