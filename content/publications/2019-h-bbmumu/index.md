abstract: 'A search for Higgs boson pair production in the $b\bar{b}WW^{\ast}$ decay mode is performed in the $b\bar{b}\ell\nu qq$ final state using 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. No evidence of events beyond the background expectation is found. 
Upper limits on the  non-resonant $pp \to HH$  production cross section of 10 pb and on the resonant production  cross section  as a function of the $HH$ invariant mass are 
obtained. Resonant production limits are set for scalar and spin-2 graviton hypotheses in the mass range 500 to 3000 GeV.'
