abstract: 'Searches for new heavy resonances decaying into different pairings of $W$, $Z$, or Higgs bosons, as well as directly into leptons, are presented using a data sample corresponding to 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13~\TeV\ collected during 2015 and 2016 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Analyses selecting bosonic decay modes in the $qqqq$, $\nu\nu qq$, $\ell\nu qq$, $\ell\ell qq$, $\ell\nu\ell\nu$, $\ell\ell\nu\nu$, $\ell\nu\ell\ell$, $\ell\ell\ell\ell$, $qqbb$, $\nu\nu bb$, $\ell\nu bb$, and $\ell\ell bb$ final states are combined, searching for a narrow-width resonance. Likewise, analyses selecting the leptonic $\ell\nu$ and $\ell\ell$ final states are also combined. These two sets of analyses are then further combined. No significant deviation from the Standard Model predictions is observed. Three benchmark models are tested: a model predicting the existence of a new heavy scalar singlet, a simplified model predicting a heavy vector-boson triplet, and a bulk Randall--Sundrum model with a heavy spin-2 Kaluza--Klein excitation of the graviton. Cross-section limits are set at the 95\% confidence level using an asymptotic approximation and are compared with predictions for the benchmark models. These limits are also expressed in terms of constraints on couplings of the heavy vector-boson triplet to quarks, leptons, and the Higgs boson. The data exclude a heavy vector-boson triplet with mass below 5.5~\TeV\ in a weakly coupled scenario and 4.5~\TeV\ in a strongly coupled scenario, as well as a Kaluza--Klein graviton with mass below 2.3~\TeV.'
