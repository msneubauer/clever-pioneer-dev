abstract: 'In this review, tests of standard electroweak (EW) theory at the highest available energies as a precursor to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) era are summarized. The primary focus is on the published results (as of March 2010) from proton-antiproton collisions at $\sqrt{s} =1.96$ TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron collected using the CDF and D0 detectors. After presenting an overview of the EW sector of the standard model, a summary of experimental tests of EW theory as of March 2010 is provided. These include gauge boson properties and self-couplings, tests of EW physics from the top-quark sector, and searches for the Higgs boson.'
