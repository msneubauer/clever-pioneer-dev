abstract: 'Most scientific discoveries depend on identifying novel signals hidden in massive, noisy datasets generated by modern experiments. Traditional novelty detection methods are often insufficient in speed, robustness, and adaptability to resource-constrained environments. We discuss a perspective on a hierarchical framework for multi-level novelty detection spanning sensor signals, feature representations, and model outputs. At the signal level, we discuss analog circuits that extract statistical densities and moments in real-time, enabling interpretable and energy-efficient filtering. At the feature level, we introduce Likelihood Regret, an unsupervised measure that detects anomalies by retraining generative models on shared latent representations, with optimizations for embedded deployment. At the output level, we leverage predictive uncertainty, applying both compute-efficient Monte Carlo reuse and Monte Carlo-free techniques like evidential learning and conformal inference. Our framework demonstrates how integrating novelty detection across the sensing-to-inference can accelerate insights in domains such as high-energy physics'
