abstract: 'We report the first observation of the associated production of a $\W$
boson and a $\Z$ boson. This result is based on 1.1 ${\rm fb}^{-1}$ of
integrated luminosity from $p\overline{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} =
1.96~{\rm TeV}$ collected with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab
Tevatron. We observe 16 $\WZ$ candidates passing our event selection
with an expected background of $2.7 \pm 0.4$ events. A fit to the
missing transverse energy distribution indicates an excess of events
compared to the background expectation corresponding to a significance
equivalent to six standard deviations. The measured cross section is 
$\sigma(p\overline{p}\rightarrow WZ) = 5.0^{+1.8}_{-1.6}$ pb,
consistent with the standard model expectation.'
