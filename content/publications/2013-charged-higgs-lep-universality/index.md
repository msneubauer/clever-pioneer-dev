abstract: 'In several extensions of the Standard Model, the top quark can 
decay into a bottom quark and a light charged Higgs boson $H^+$, 
$t \rightarrow bH^+$, in addition to the Standard Model decay 
$t \rightarrow bW$. Since $W$ bosons decay to the three lepton 
generations equally, while $H^+$ may predominantly decay into 
$\tau\nu$, charged Higgs bosons can be searched for using the 
violation of lepton universality in top quark decays. The 
analysis in this paper is based on \LUMI of proton--proton 
collision data at $\sqrt{s} = 7~\mbox{TeV}$ collected by 
the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. 
Signatures containing leptons ($e$ or $\mu$) and/or a 
hadronically decaying $\tau$ ($\tau_{\text{had}}$) are 
used. Event yield ratios between $e+\tau_{\text{had}}$ 
and $e+\mu$, as well as between $\mu+\tau_{\text{had}}$ 
and $\mu+e$, final states are measured in the data and 
compared to predictions from simulations. This ratio-based 
method reduces the impact of systematic uncertainties in 
the analysis. No significant deviation from the Standard 
Model predictions is observed. With the assumption that 
the branching fraction ${\cal B}(H^+ \rightarrow \tau\nu)$ 
is 100\%, upper limits in the range 3.2\%--4.4\% can be placed 
on the branching fraction ${\cal B}(t\rightarrow bH^+)$ for 
charged Higgs boson masses $m_{H^+}$ in the range 90--140~GeV. 
After combination with results from a search for charged Higgs 
bosons in $t\bar{t}$ decays using the $\tau_{\text{had}}$+jets 
final state, upper limits on ${\cal B}(t\rightarrow bH^+)$ can 
be set in the range 0.8\%--3.4\%, for $m_{H^+}$ in the range 
90--160~GeV.'
