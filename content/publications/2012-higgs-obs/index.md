abstract: 'A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in
  proton-proton collisions with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is
  presented.  The datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities
  of approximately 4.8~\ifb\ collected at $\sqrt{s}=7$\,TeV in 2011 and 5.8~\ifb\
  at $\sqrt{s}=8$\,TeV in 2012.  Individual searches in the channels
  \htollll, \hgg\ and $\hWWenmun$ in the
  8\,TeV data are combined with previously published results of
  searches for $H{\rightarrow\,}ZZ^{(*)}$, $WW^{(*)}$, \bbbar\ and
  $\tau^+\tau^-$ in the 7\,TeV data and results from improved analyses of the \htollll\ and
  \hgg\  channels in the 7\,TeV data.  Clear evidence
  for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of $\massresultStatSys$ 
  is presented. This observation, which has a significance of 5.9 standard deviations,
  corresponding to a background fluctuation probability of $1.7\times 10^{-9}$, 
  is compatible with the production and decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson'
